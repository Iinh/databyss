# databyss-ui

This is a component and module library for databyss applications.

The goals of the package are

- to allow application developers to easily build new applications or features
- and to provide, through documented recommendations and examples, standards of semantics, aesthetics and accessibility across all databyss applications.

## Directory Structure

## Stylesheets

This library uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to generate stylesheets. Sass allows us to create shared variables and functions so that we can use to keep our styles consistent and DRY.

The `css-loader` webpack module is configred to use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader#modules) to create locally scoped classes.

Stylesheet sources are written in SCSS format. Each component or module directory should have exactly one stylesheet source file, named `styles.scss`. There may be more than one component or module grouped into one directory, so several components may reference the same CSS class namespace.

## Fonts

This library uses proprietary fonts

With Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.

You can **`import` a file right in a JavaScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the `src` attribute of an image or the `href` of a link to a PDF.

To reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are less than 10,000 bytes returns a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to [#1153](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1153).

Here is an example:

```js
import React from 'react'
import logo from './logo.png' // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image

console.log(logo) // /logo.84287d09.png

function Header() {
  // Import result is the URL of your image
  return <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />
}

export default Header
```

This ensures that when the project is built, Webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.

This works in CSS too:

```css
.Logo {
  background-image: url(./logo.png);
}
```

Webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you donâ€™t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.

Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.

**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).<br>
An alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.
